          Welcome to LawMarket, a decentralized platform for legal marketplaces
          built on the Ethereum blockchain. This project allows lawyers and
          clients to interact directly without intermediaries, creating a more
          efficient and cost-effective legal marketplace. The project is
          implemented in Solidity, a programming language specifically designed
          for smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
