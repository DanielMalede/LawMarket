<h1>LawMarket</h1>
Welcome to LawMarket, a decentralized platform for legal marketplaces
built on the Ethereum blockchain. This project allows lawyers and
clients to interact directly without intermediaries, creating a more
efficient and cost-effective legal marketplace. The project is
implemented in Solidity, a programming language specifically designed
for smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
        

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
To use LawMarket, you will need to have access to a web3-enabled
browser, such as MetaMask. Once you have set up your browser, you can

<h2>Features</h2>
<h3>The LawMarket platform includes several features to facilitate
interactions between lawyers and clients, including:</h3>
